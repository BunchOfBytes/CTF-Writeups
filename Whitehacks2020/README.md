WhiteHacks is an event organised by SMU Whitehats. The event involved a 1-day CTF competition involving challenges from a multitude of categories. All in all, team BunchOfBytes 
did a pretty great job at WhiteHacks 2020, achieving 6th out of 63 teams which solved at least one challenge. Considering that all of us in BunchOfBytes are J1s, we hope to 
participate in more CTFs this year and the next and keeping capturing more flags.
